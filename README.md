Horse Breeding Simulator
A simple project with room to grow into a complex horse breeding simulator.

A horse starts life as either a filly or a colt. The horse will be born with certain characteristics that are inherited from its Stud and Broodmare.

Trait attributes will be assigned when the horse grows from the Filly or Colt stage, into a Mare or Stallion, respectively. Parental traits will be considered when child traits are determined.

A Stallion and Mare connot reproduce until they are marked as Stud or Broodmare, respectively. Once this decision is made, it cannot be undone.
